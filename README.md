# *The Game*
1. The games I made are Chess and Checkers
2. Classic games that have been played for a long time, where a lot of logic is involved.
3. Will need to click on the links that will be added in the near future

3. What were you most pleased with:
  * I am pleased at how quickly I can now do the html and css of the page.
  * Rather than pleased, I am glad that I chose to code such difficult games. This is because I was able to expand my knowledge and way of thinking in terms of logically coding the game.
4. What was the most challenging part:
  * Everything
  * With chess, it was logically hard to think of all the ways to code the rules. Lots of problems would pop up along the way that could be integrated with the function I was coding.
  * With checkers, the way I named the variables got very confusing in the later stages, where there were too many "pieces".
